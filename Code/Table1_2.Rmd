## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Load the necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Data for heritability of different elements
elements <- c("Weight", "B", "Na", "Mg", "Al", "P", "S", "K", "Ca", "Mn", "Fe", "Co", "Ni", "Cu", "Zn", "As", "Se", "Rb", "Sr", "Mo", "Cd")
heritability_2010 <- c(NA, 0.63, 0.28, 0.81, 0.3, 0.81, 0.81, 0.65, 0.6, 0.78, 0.74, 0.5, 0.6, 0.84, 0.81, 0.66, 0.47, 0.54, 0.53, 0.6, 0.75)
heritability_2011 <- c(NA, 0.56, 0.52, 0.84, 0.43, 0.71, 0.61, 0.65, 0.69, 0.71, 0.8, 0.54, 0.58, 0.86, 0.83, 0.62, 0.28, 0.64, 0.57, 0.63, 0.9)
heritability_combined <- c(0.53, 0.37, 0.12, 0.73, 0.12, 0.38, 0.55, 0.46, 0.5, 0.54, 0.7, 0.5, 0.39, 0.77, 0.67, 0.52, 0.25, 0.32, 0.31, 0.55, 0.79)

# Create a data frame
data <- data.frame(Element = rep(elements, each = 3),
                   Heritability = c(heritability_2010, heritability_2011, heritability_combined),
                   Year = rep(c("2010", "2011", "Combined"), times = length(elements)))

# Plotting with adjusted bar width and spacing
ggplot(data, aes(x = Element, y = Heritability, fill = Year)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(width = 1.0), width = 0.45) + # Increased bar width and adjusted dodge
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5)) +
  labs(title = "Heritability of Elements for 2010, 2011, and Combined",
       x = "Element",
       y = "Heritability") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")  # Using a color palette that is color-blind friendly

summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
