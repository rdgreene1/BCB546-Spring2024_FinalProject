# Final Project

## Group Members

Kiara Kappelmann, Tae-Chun Park, Panchali Chakraborty, Maliha Jahan, Sharmistha Goswami, Russell Greene

## Original Paper

We chose to re-create the data from the paper found here: <https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0087628>

The original paper has three figures, but we chose to create a few of our own figures from the data since we had six group members.

## Data

The original data files can be found in the `Data` folder. These files were used to re-create the plots.

## Code

All the code we used can be found in `Code` folder.

### Figure 1

The final code used to generate figure 1 can be found in the `Figure1.Rmd` file. The `Figure1_FinalProject.R` file contains the crude code troubleshooting that was used to generate the final .Rmd file. The `Figure1.Rmd` file contains all the descriptions of the code in markdown text and how the data was formatted to create figure 1. 
### Figure 2
The final code used to generate "Fig_2_elemental_accumulation_plot_all_20.png" and "Fig_2_elemental_accumulation_plot_7significant.png" can be found in `Fig_2_all20_elements.R` and `Fig_2_7significant_elememts.Rmd` file respectively

## Table 3
The final code used to generate Table3_figure can be found in the 'Table3_figure_codes.Rmd'. The Table3_figure_codes.r file contains the crude code troubleshooting that was used to generate the Table3_figure_codes.Rmd the which contains all the descriptions of the code in markdown text.

### Table 4

The PLOS 2014 paper provides a tabular format to show significant QTL contributing to elemental phenotypes. On the same premise, files were generated to perform the QTL analysis, but instead of presenting them in tabular format, they are presented in QTL visualizations and QTL effect plots for chromosome 1. The final code used to generate the visualizations using inspiration from Table 4 can be found in the `Table4QTLanalysis.Rmd` file. The `Table4QTLanalysis.R` file is a raw script used to generate the visualizations for this portion of the project.

### Figure 3

The code used to generate figure 3 can be found in the Code folder. There are two code files (`Final_project_code_figure3.R`, and `Final_project_figure3.Rmd`), and each file has the descriptions to create the figure 3.



## Visualizations

Final figures can be found in the `Visualizations` folder. 

### Figure 1


The final file for figure 1 is the `Figure1.png` file. An additional figure was generated from the data used to make figure 1 that visualizes all 20 elements at once. This file can be found as `Figure1_all_elements.png`. 

### Figure2
The original Figure 2 from the paper was reproduced and named "Fig_2_elemental_accumulation_plot_7significant.png". This plot includes all 7 elements for which accumulation of the effect of position within the cob was significant. There is an additional figure named "Fig_2_elemental_accumulation_plot_all_20.png," which includes all 20 elements on which it was tested.

## Table3_figure
The final file for Table3 figure is the `Table3_figure.png` file given in the Visualization folder.

### Figures from Table 4
There are three figures generated from table 4. `Table4_QTL_ScanChr1` is a QTL scan of chromosome 1. `Table4_QTL_effect_MarkerFromAnalysis` is a visualization depicting the effect of the QTL on the mean Selenium phenotype when using the marker from the upstream analysis. `Table4_QTL_effect_MarkerFromPaper` is a visualization depicting the effect of the QTL on the mean Selenium phenotype when using the marker that was reported in the paper.

The final file for figure 1 is the `Figure1.png` file. An additional figure was generated from the data used to make figure 1 that visualizes all 20 elements at once. This file can be found as `Figure1_all_elements.png`. 

### Figure 3

There are 4 figures in the Visualizations folder. Two of those (`Figure3_whole_Ca.jpeg`, and `Figure3_whole_Zn.jpeg`) were created to compare the Ca and Zn content of the entire population by different Su type. The remaining two figures (`Figure3_group_Ca.jpeg`, and `Figure3_group_Zn.jpeg`) were made by randomly sampling 7 groups to create figures similar to those in the paper.
